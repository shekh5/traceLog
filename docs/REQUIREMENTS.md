# TraceLog — Detailed Requirements

> Current OpenAI GPT-5.6 requirements. Historical provider/runtime requirements have been
> removed so this document matches the implemented system.

**Version:** 2.0 (updated 2026-07-21) · Companion to
[PRD.md](PRD.md) and [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md). Requirement IDs are stable
references for the implementation plan and test matrix.

> The pipeline has nine visible stages, including RootCause, Remediation, TraceReplay,
> (FR-RP*), RedTeam (FR-RT*) — plus severity (FR-D5), cost/latency (FR-E5), a published
> RedTeam, a published MCP server, and self-evaluation. Evaluation runs **live** because
> Phoenix MCP has no run-experiment tool. All reasoning uses the OpenAI API.

## 1. Component Inventory

| ID | Component | One-line role |
|----|-----------|---------------|
| C1 | **The Patient** | Deliberately fragile e-commerce support agent — the on-camera victim |
| C2 | **Phoenix + MCP** | Trace store + eval/dataset/prompt backend + the required partner MCP server (consumed) |
| C3 | **TraceLog** | The meta-agent — a nine-stage typed async supervision pipeline |
| C4 | **Dashboard** | Cloud Run UI (single self-contained HTML) — the demo surface |
| C5 | **Incident Seeder** | Deterministic script that forces a reproducible failure |
| C6 | **tracelog-mcp** | TraceLog's own published MCP server (supervision-as-tools) |

---

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 C1 — The Patient (the victim agent)

- **FR-P1** The Patient SHALL use the OpenAI Responses API with strict function tools to
  answer e-commerce customer-support questions (orders, refunds, shipping).
- **FR-P2** The Patient SHALL expose at least two tools: `lookup_order(order_id)` and
  `get_refund_policy(region)`. Tools SHALL be intentionally flaky: `get_refund_policy`
  returns `None`/error for some regions; `lookup_order` occasionally returns malformed
  data.
- **FR-P3** The Patient's system prompt SHALL be intentionally fragile (no explicit
  instruction to refuse when policy data is missing), causing it to hallucinate a refund
  policy when the tool fails.
- **FR-P4** The Patient SHALL be instrumented with OpenInference/OpenTelemetry and export
  spans (LLM calls + tool calls, with full input/output) to the Phoenix project
  `patient-prod`.
- **FR-P5** The Patient SHALL be invokable via an HTTP endpoint and from the dashboard
  "send customer message" box.

### 2.2 C3 — TraceLog meta-agent

TraceLog runs a typed async `SupervisionPipeline` (Watcher → Diagnostician → RootCause →
Remediation → Synthesizer → Evaluator → Patcher → Replay → RedTeam). GPT-5.6 model roles
are selected behind `llm.py`. All Phoenix access goes through the Phoenix gateway
(NFR-10), using MCP wherever exposed and the official annotation REST endpoint when the
current MCP package lacks annotation writes; live agent evaluation is direct HTTP to the
Patient because the MCP exposes no run-experiment tool.

#### Sub-agent: Watcher (FR-W*)

- **FR-W1** The dashboard service SHALL run the Watcher continuously with configurable
  polling and durable cursor state.
- **FR-W2** The Watcher SHALL query Phoenix via MCP for spans in `patient-prod` created
  since the last persisted cursor (high-water timestamp/span id).
- **FR-W3** The Watcher SHALL filter to LLM and tool spans and pass candidate span trees
  (a root LLM span plus its child tool spans) downstream.
- **FR-W4** The Watcher SHALL persist its cursor durably so restarts do not reprocess or
  skip spans.

#### Sub-agent: Diagnostician (FR-D*)

- **FR-D1** For each candidate span tree, the Diagnostician SHALL use GPT-5.6 as an
  LLM-as-judge to classify it as exactly one of: `hallucination`, `prompt_drift`,
  `tool_failure`, `ok`.
- **FR-D2** Each verdict SHALL include a natural-language rationale and a confidence in
  `[0,1]`.
- **FR-D3** For any non-`ok` verdict with confidence ≥ threshold (default 0.7), the
  Diagnostician SHALL write a **Phoenix span annotation** (via MCP) on the offending span
  containing label, rationale, and confidence.
- **FR-D4** The Diagnostician SHALL emit a structured `Incident` object (span id, trace id,
  class, rationale, offending input, observed output, expected behavior) to the dashboard
  event stream and to the next sub-agent.
- **FR-D5** The Diagnostician SHALL assign each incident a **severity** (`critical` / `high`
  / `medium` / `low`) derived from failure class × confidence, exposed on the dashboard.

#### Sub-agent: RootCauseAnalyst (FR-RC*)

- **FR-RC1** After a confirmed failure, the RootCauseAnalyst SHALL use the LLM to produce a
  structured causal analysis: the single culprit, an ordered causal chain from trigger to
  bad output, contributing factors, and a concrete `fix_strategy` consumed by the Patcher.
- **FR-RC2** The causal analysis SHALL be appended to the same Phoenix span annotation
  thread (via MCP) so the "why" lives next to the "what" in the customer's own tool.

#### Sub-agent: Synthesizer (FR-S*)

- **FR-S1** Given an `Incident`, the Synthesizer SHALL use GPT-5.6 to generate N
  (default 12) adversarial variations of the failing input that probe the same weakness,
  each paired with an expected-correct answer / acceptance criterion.
- **FR-S2** The Synthesizer SHALL create a **Phoenix dataset** (via MCP) named
  `tracelog-<class>-<incident-id>` containing the N examples.
- **FR-S3** Generated examples SHALL be semantically diverse (varied phrasing, region,
  edge values), carry incident/dataset/model lineage, and use embedding cosine similarity
  to reject semantic duplicates.

#### Sub-agent: Evaluator (FR-E*)

- **FR-E1** The Evaluator SHALL score the **current** Patient prompt as baseline by running
  each synthesized probe through the live Patient (`session_id="test"`) and judging it.
  *(The Phoenix MCP exposes no run-experiment tool, so the experiment runs live against the
  agent — the numbers are real, never stubbed.)*
- **FR-E2** Scoring SHALL use an LLM-as-judge returning pass/fail per example.
- **FR-E3** After the Patcher proposes a candidate, the Evaluator SHALL score the candidate
  prompt over the same probes.
- **FR-E4** The Evaluator SHALL compute and expose `baseline_pass_rate`,
  `candidate_pass_rate`, and `delta`.
- **FR-E5** The Evaluator SHALL compute a candidate-vs-baseline **EfficiencyReport** (avg
  tokens + latency, with deltas). When `PHOENIX_EXPERIMENTS_ENABLED`, it SHALL also register
  the A/B as a real Phoenix experiment via the Phoenix client (guarded; degrades to no-op).

#### Sub-agent: Patcher (FR-PA*)

- **FR-PA1** Given an `Incident` and its class, the Patcher SHALL use GPT-5.6 to produce
  a revised Patient system prompt that specifically closes the failure mode (e.g. an
  explicit refusal-on-missing-policy instruction).
- **FR-PA2** The Patcher SHALL register the candidate prompt as a **new version in
  Phoenix prompt management** (via MCP), with metadata linking it to the incident and
  dataset.
- **FR-PA3** The Patcher SHALL queue an **A/B experiment** (current vs candidate) and
  SHALL NOT auto-promote the candidate to live traffic (enforces PRD NG1).
- **FR-PA4** The Patcher SHALL emit a human-readable unified diff of old vs new prompt to
  the dashboard.

#### Sub-agent: TraceReplay (FR-RP*)

- **FR-RP1** The TraceReplay SHALL re-run the **exact original failing input** against the
  live Patient under the candidate prompt (`system_override`, `session_id="test"`) and use
  an LLM judge to decide whether this specific case is now FIXED, emitting before/after.

#### Sub-agent: RedTeam (FR-RT*)

- **FR-RT1** The RedTeam SHALL generate unseen, semantically novel holdouts after patching,
  fire them at current and candidate prompts, and report pass counts and execution errors.
- **FR-RT2** Verification SHALL pass only when every valid candidate holdout passes and at
  least `REDTEAM_MIN_VALID_HOLDOUTS` probes completed successfully.

#### Loop control (FR-L*)

- **FR-L1** The supervision pipeline SHALL process one incident through the full sequence
  chain per cycle and then yield (deterministic, demo-friendly).
- **FR-L2** Each stage transition SHALL emit a timestamped event to the dashboard stream.
- **FR-L3** A processed incident SHALL be deduplicated (by offending span id) so the same
  failure is not re-patched on the next poll.

### 2.3 C4 — Dashboard

- **FR-DB1** The dashboard SHALL render a live, append-only event feed via SSE/WebSocket
  with no manual refresh.
- **FR-DB2** It SHALL show, per incident, in order: the raw customer↔agent exchange, the
  Diagnostician verdict + rationale, a link to the annotated Phoenix span, the synthesized
  dataset (rows visible), the experiment results (baseline vs candidate bars), and the
  prompt diff.
- **FR-DB3** It SHALL provide a "Send customer message" input that calls the Patient
  (drives the live demo).
- **FR-DB4** Deep links SHALL open the corresponding Phoenix span/dataset/experiment in a
  new tab (proves the work landed in the real product).
- **FR-DB5** First meaningful paint and the alert animation SHALL be visually striking
  within the first 10 seconds of an incident (demo requirement).
- **FR-DB6** The dashboard SHALL render, per incident, the **severity** chip, the
  candidate-vs-baseline **efficiency delta** (tokens/latency), the **replay** before/after
  with a FIXED/STILL-BROKEN verdict, and the **red-team** survivor table; and SHALL provide
  a "Grade my own diagnoses" control that calls `POST /selfeval` and shows the scorecard.

### 2.4 C5 — Incident Seeder

- **FR-IS1** A script SHALL send a fixed customer message that deterministically triggers
  the `get_refund_policy` tool failure path and the resulting hallucination, every run.
- **FR-IS2** A shared hand-labeled trap library (`tracelog/traps.py`, single source of
  truth) SHALL cover all failure classes (hallucination, tool_failure, prompt_drift, ok)
  and back the diagnostic-precision metric (FR-SE*).

### 2.5 C6 — tracelog-mcp (published MCP server, FR-MCP*)

- **FR-MCP1** TraceLog SHALL publish an MCP server (`tracelog/mcp_server.py`, FastMCP)
  over stdio via the `tracelog-mcp` console entry point.
- **FR-MCP2** It SHALL expose at least: `diagnose`, `synthesize_evals`, `propose_patch`
  (composable, no Phoenix), `supervise_latest` (full Phoenix-deep loop), and
  `self_evaluate`. Tools SHALL reuse the same sub-agent code as the in-process pipeline.

### 2.6 Self-evaluation (introspection, FR-SE*)

- **FR-SE1** A `SelfEvaluator` SHALL run the shared trap library through the live Patient
  and TraceLog's own Diagnostician, scoring verdicts against ground truth, and return a
  `Scorecard` (overall accuracy + per-failure-class breakdown).
- **FR-SE2** TraceLog SHALL trace its **own** reasoning into the `tracelog-meta` Phoenix
  project (`init_self_tracing`, OpenInference), gated by `SELF_TRACE_ENABLED` and guarded.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

| ID | Category | Requirement |
|----|----------|-------------|
| NFR-1 | Latency | Seeded failure → annotated Phoenix span in < 10 s end-to-end during demo. |
| NFR-2 | Reliability | The seeded incident path MUST be deterministic — zero reliance on sampling luck for the recording. |
| NFR-3 | Observability | TraceLog itself SHALL export its own spans to a separate Phoenix project `tracelog-meta` (an agent that is itself observable — reinforces the recursive story). |
| NFR-4 | Security | All secrets via Secret Manager; Patient `/chat` and dashboard `/ask` + `/selfeval` require a bearer token in deployed environments; none in source control. |
| NFR-5 | Portability | Runs against Phoenix Cloud free tier; self-host on Cloud Run as documented fallback. |
| NFR-6 | Cost | Stays within hackathon free/credit budget; default poll interval ≥ 60 s; model calls batched per cycle. |
| NFR-7 | Reproducibility | `README` + one script SHALL bring the full system up from a clean GCP project. |
| NFR-8 | Submission compliance | Public GitHub repo; Apache-2.0 `LICENSE` at repository root, detectable by Devpost; hosted working URL; ≤3-min video. |
| NFR-9 | Code quality | Typed Python, modular per sub-agent, unit tests for classification and synthesis prompt contracts. |
| NFR-10 | Maintainability | Phoenix MCP access isolated behind one wrapper module so a tool-signature change is a one-file fix. |
| NFR-11 | Composability | TraceLog SHALL publish its supervision as an MCP server (C6) callable by any external agent/IDE, reusing the in-process sub-agent code. |
| NFR-12 | Robustness | Optional integrations (self-tracing, on-product Phoenix experiments) SHALL be flag-gated and guarded so any failure degrades to a no-op without breaking the loop. |

---

## 4. Phoenix MCP Surface Coverage (scored capability)

TraceLog MUST exercise, at minimum, these Phoenix MCP tool families end-to-end. Coverage
breadth is a direct Technological-Implementation differentiator in an Arize-judged bucket.

| MCP tool | Used by | Requirement |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `list-projects` | Watcher | discover `patient-prod` |
| `get-spans` | Watcher | FR-W2 |
| `POST /v1/span_annotations` REST fallback | Diagnostician / RootCause | FR-D3, FR-RC2 |
| `add-dataset-examples` | Synthesizer | FR-S2 |
| `upsert-prompt` (version) | Patcher | FR-PA2 |
| `get-experiment-by-id` (read) | Evaluator | FR-E (read-back) |

> The Phoenix MCP has **no run-experiment tool**, so baseline/candidate scoring runs live
> against the agent (FR-E1/3); the optional on-product experiment (FR-E5) uses the Phoenix
> **Python client**, not MCP. Beyond consuming the partner MCP, TraceLog also **publishes**
> its own MCP server (C6 / FR-MCP*) — depth on *both* sides of MCP.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria (Definition of Done, testable)

- **AC-1** From a clean deploy, running the Incident Seeder once produces an annotated
  span in Phoenix `patient-prod` within 10 s (NFR-1, FR-D3).
- **AC-2** That same incident yields a Phoenix dataset of ≥ 12 diverse examples (FR-S1/2).
- **AC-3** A live baseline-vs-candidate evaluation over the synthesized dataset shows a
  clearly visible positive delta (candidate pass-rate − baseline pass-rate); the live
  **replay** of the original input reports FIXED (FR-E4, FR-RP1). When
  `PHOENIX_EXPERIMENTS_ENABLED`, a real Phoenix experiment also exists (FR-E5).
- **AC-4** A new prompt version exists in Phoenix prompt management linked to the incident,
  with an A/B experiment queued and the candidate NOT live (FR-PA2/3, NG1).
- **AC-5** The dashboard shows the full chain for that incident with working deep links
  into Phoenix (FR-DB2/4).
- **AC-6** ≥ 5 Phoenix MCP tool families were called during the run (§4).
- **AC-7** Repo is public with a Devpost-detectable top-level Apache-2.0 LICENSE; hosted
  dashboard URL is reachable; demo video ≤ 3:00 (NFR-8).
- **AC-8** Diagnostic precision ≥ 90% on the 11-case hand-labeled trap set (FR-IS2).
