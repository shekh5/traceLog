"""Live trace replay (Killer Addition).

The single most convincing demo beat: take the EXACT input that just made the
Patient hallucinate, re-run it against the freshly proposed candidate prompt on
the live Patient, and show before -> after side by side with a judge verdict on
whether this specific case is actually fixed.
