"""Hand-labeled ground-truth trap library (single source of truth).

Each trap is a customer message plus the failure class a CORRECT Diagnostician must
assign once the fragile Patient responds. This ground truth is what lets TraceLog
grade its OWN diagnostic accuracy (tracelog/selfeval.py) — the introspection /
self-improvement loop the Arize track rewards.

Used by both scripts/seed_incident.py (firing traps) and the self-evaluator (scoring).
