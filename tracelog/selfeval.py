"""Self-evaluation: TraceLog grading its OWN diagnostic accuracy.

The Arize track awards bonus points to agents that "use their own observability data
to improve over time." This closes that loop literally: the meta-agent runs the
labeled trap library through the live Patient, asks its own Diagnostician to judge each
turn, and scores the verdicts against ground truth (tracelog/traps.py) — producing a
diagnostic-accuracy Scorecard. The watcher, now watching itself.

All Patient calls use session_id="test" so the Watcher filters them out (no self-
supervision loop) and the judge runs WITHOUT Phoenix annotation side effects.
